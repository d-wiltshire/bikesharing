## Overview

The goal of this exercise is to analyze NYC Citibike data from August 2019 and to describe various metrics using visualizations in Tableau. The use case for these visualizations is a fictitious pitch to a body of investors to create a similar bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. The visualizations depict information like the total number of rides broken down by gender, trip duration, time of day, etc., in order to help the investors make an informed decision. 

The resulting Story <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david1924/viz/August2019CitibikeUsage/August2019CitibikeUsage">can be viewed on Tableau Public here</a>.


## Results

The Tableau Story contains seven visualizations:

* Checkout Times for Users (i.e., checkout durations): a graph of the duration of time that bikes are checked out for all riders
  - The results show that the vast majority of riders checked out a bike for less than an hour.
* Checkout Times by Gender: a graph of the duration of time that bikes are checked out for all riders, broken down by gender
  - The results show that the trends for ride duration among the genders are similar. In addition, these results show that the majority of rides are taken by men.
* Trips by Weekday per Hour: a graph of the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap
  - The results show
* Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour): a graph of the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap, divided by gender into multiple heatmaps
  - The results show
* Trips by Gender, by Weekday, by User Type: a heatmap that shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each user type (i.e., whether the user is a customer or a subscriber)
  - The results show
* Customers by User Type: a pie chart depicting the percentages of users who are customers and who are subscribers
  - The results show
* Bike Usage by Hour: a bar chart showing the hours of the day when rides were initiated (trip start time)
  - The results show



## Summary

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)

The results show...

### Additional suggestions for future visualizations

Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
* first
* second






The dataset used for this exercise contained information only regarding Citibike in NYC. However, much of the information important to investors would have to do with Des Moines itself as a market for rental bikes. For example, it would be helpful to provide visualizations regarding:

* A map showing population density of Des Moines vs. NYC, especially relative to the places frequented by tourists
* Percentages of NYC bikes rented by tourists vs. residents
* Information regarding tourism revenue in NYC compared with Des Moines
* A map of Des Moines indicating which streets have bike lanes or where bikes are permitted on sidewalks
